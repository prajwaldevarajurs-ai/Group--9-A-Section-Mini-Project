    <h1>About This Weather Forecast Application</h1>

    <p>
        This Weather Forecast Application is a web-based system developed using
        the Django framework. It enables users to search for any city and instantly
        view real-time weather conditions along with a detailed 5-day forecast.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application retrieves live weather data from the
        <strong>OpenWeatherMap API</strong>, ensuring accurate and up-to-date
        information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall
        weather trends.
    </p>

    <h3>Application Features</h3>

    <p>
        The system provides real-time weather updates, extended weather
        forecasting, a user-friendly city search interface, and automatic
        tracking of previously searched cities. The interface is designed to be
        clean, simple, and easy to understand.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>

    <p>
        This project is implemented using Python and the Django web framework
        for backend development. HTML and CSS are used for frontend design,
        while the OpenWeatherMap API supplies live weather data. An SQLite
        database is used to store user search history.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this project demonstrates practical implementation of API
        integration, database management, and dynamic web application
        development using Django.
